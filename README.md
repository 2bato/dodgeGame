# My Personal Project

## What will the application do?
The project will consist of a game where the player attempts to 
dodge projectiles fired at them. Possible features include 
- lives
- different types of projectiles
- a high-score board of all the games
(X could be the score of a game. Y could be a list of high-scores) 
## Who will use it?
Bored students and children during their free time!
## Why is this project of interest to you?
Seeing that I have done to-do list types of projects in the past, 
I want to create something unique that challenges myself for this project. 
As someone who always hung around arcades as a child, what better to work
on than a simple game?
